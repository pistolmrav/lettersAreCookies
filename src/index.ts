// Todo 1. Parse example Array<string> in a way we get each string item and split it into array of strings so that we can get y coord of the map
// Todo 2. Check if each item is valid -> it has both start and end character @ & x
// Todo 3. Find the start position and get its coordinates
// Todo 4. Declare directions we can move to Up, Down, Left, Right
// Todo 5. Find possible directions to move to from our currentPosition
// Todo 6. Check validate each possible direction and filter the others
// Todo 7. Decide where to go next -> prioritize going straight unless we are at the turn sign: +
// Todo 8. Update the state with the new position, update the path we went through and update the letters we have eaten
// Todo 9. Check if we are at the end: x, if so end the journey and prompt the user to go again
// Todo 10. If we are not at the end repeat from 5.
